/**
 * Server-side ingest write path — audit column (`import_batches.created_by`).
 *
 * The persist runs through the secret-key admin client, which has no session, so
 * the DB's `auth.uid()` default for `created_by` is always null and would violate
 * the NOT NULL constraint. Since 0007 the persist is one atomic `ingest_persist`
 * rpc; the resolved user is passed as `p_actor` (the SQL function stamps it onto
 * the import_batches row + audit). These tests prove the write path sends the
 * authenticated user explicitly, and refuses (clear error, no rpc) when none is
 * resolved — rather than ever relying on a null default.
